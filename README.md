# Camo_mismatch
Data and script supporting the manuscripts on snow camouflage mismatch in northern Sweden.

**Abstract**

Camouflage expressed by animals is an adaptation to local environments that certain animals express to maximise survival and fitness. Animals at higher latitudes change their coat colour according to a seasonally changing environment, expressing a white coat in winter and a darker coat in summer. The timing of moulting is tightly linked to the appearance and disappearance of snow and is mainly regulated by photoperiod. However, due to climate change an increasing mismatch is observed between the coat colour of these species and their environment. Here, we conducted an experiment in northern Sweden, with white and brown decoys to study how camouflage (mis)-match influenced 1) predator attraction to decoys, and 2) predation events. Using camera trap data, we showed that mismatching decoys attracted more predators and experienced a higher likelihood of predation events in comparison to matching decoys, suggesting that camouflage mismatched animals experience increased detection by predators. These results provide insight into the function of a seasonal colour coat and the need for this adaptation to maximise fitness in an environment that is exposed to high seasonality. Thus, our results suggest that, with increasing climate change and reduced snow cover, animals expressing a seasonal colour coat will experience a decrease in survival. 

**Data**

The observation file contains a camera trap data output file from Trapper as used in the manuscript. The camera_dat.xlsx file contains data on the deployments, and the missing data for decoys without observations. 
The analysis.R file contains the description and all the code needed to run the analyiss of the manuscript.
